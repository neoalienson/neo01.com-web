            <p>In my previous post, I setup game from prompts shared by others. This time, I’m excited to share that I’ve crafted my own game prompt. The cultural backdrop is the Sung dynasty of ancient China and you are defending City of Xiangyang against Mongol horde!</p>
<p>The game is about Chinese. Can I have the game in Chinese? LLaMA 3 struggles with understanding Chinese text. On the other handed, Chinese-fine-tuned LLaMA 3 models lack the ability to take instructions well. As a result, the game is translating text from English to Chinese. Is at the end of this page.</p>
<p>I have three different game endings. One is where I escape from the city that’s been destroyed (thanks to a brave solider sacarifying himself), another is where I push a cart full of gunpowder into the Mongol camp and break the siege, and finally there’s one where the Emperor of Sung leads an army to defeat the Mongol invaders!</p>

Welcome to "Became a Hero of Xiangyang"!
<p>You wake up from a barrack in the city of Xiangyang, feeling a bit groggy from a long night of sleep. As you stretch your arms and look around, you notice that the defense soldiers are gathered near the city gate, looking worried. One of them approaches you.</p>
<p>Defense Guard 1: “Greetings, hero! We’re in a bit of a pickle here. Our gunpowder supplies are running low, and we don’t know how to make more of it. Can you help us figure out what’s going on?”</p>
<p>The defense soldiers are conscripts who cannot read and have no knowledge of chemistry or the modern world. They rely solely on oral tradition and practical skills.</p>
<p>Your Current Situation:</p>
<p>City Defense: 0<br>
Mongol Assault: 2 (outnumbering the defense 10 to 1)<br>
Technological Innovation: 0<br>

Let's get this explosive party started! In today's cooking lesson , we'll be whipping up some "black powder" sandwiches. Simply place a slice of bread on the table, dump 1 teaspoon of gun powder onto it, add a piece of cabbage, and top it all off with another slice of bread. Taste the master piece made by you!

Defense Guard 2: "Uh, hero... I think there might be some misunderstanding here. We're trying to defend our city from the Mongol army, not make sandwiches! Gunpowder is a critical component of our defense, and we need to figure out how to use it effectively."

Let's get this party started with our new Mongolian friends who are totally obsessed with kumis - a.k.a. horse milk! We'll add some black powder to make it extra special, then kick open the gate and get ready to chug-a-lug with our new nomadic pals.

讓我們和新蒙古朋友一起開始這個派對吧，他們完全癡迷於kumis - 又名馬奶！我們將添加一些黑火藥，讓它更加特別，然後踢開大門，準備與我們的新遊牧夥伴一起大快朵頤。
