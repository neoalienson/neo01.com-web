            <p><img src="index.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a growing demand within enterprises for a reliable method to trace software artifacts back to their original source code and build instructions, driven by the rise in supply chain attacks. This need also applies to other common enterprise scenarios, such as siloed teamwork and the diversification of DevSecOps practices. While enterprises often have access to a broad range of DevSecOps tools on the market, the more tools they adopt, the more fragmented and isolated their processes tend to become.</p>
<h2 id="The-Tooling-Conundrum-Integration-Overload">The Tooling Conundrum: Integration Overload</h2>
<p>Once an enterprise has equipped itself with a wide array of DevSecOps tools, the next challenge is integrating them to minimize fragmentation. The market offers numerous tools, each claiming to be the ultimate solution for security challenges. However, in reality, no single tool can address all issues comprehensively. The key challenge is to build a cohesive ecosystem where these tools operate in harmony, ensuring a transparent and efficient pipeline for software delivery.</p>
<p>Many enterprises choose to develop their own developer portals that integrate or consume scanning reports from these tools and provide a unified view for developers and security engineers. This approach allows for centralized management of vulnerabilities, compliance checks, and other security-related tasks. However, it requires <strong>significant investment</strong> in development and maintenance. Without proper integration and a seamless workflow, these tools can become a nightmare for development teams. Additionally, different development teams often have distinct tooling for their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC); for example, mobile development teams may use specialized scanning tools.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Attestation">What is Attestation?</h2>
<p>Let’s explore some background on attestation before understanding how Attestation-Centric DevSecOps addresses the aforementioned problems. Attestations are a set of tools and practices that enable every step in the SDLC to create a secure and verifiable link between software artifacts and the processes that produced them. These attestations serve as a tamper-proof, unforgeable paper trail that details every step of the software creation process, from code commits to build and deployment.</p>
<p>The process of creating an Artifact Attestation typically involves generating cryptographically signed claims that certify the provenance of a software build. This includes information such as the workflow associated with the artifact, the repository, organization, environment, commit SHA, and the triggering event for the build. We refer to this information as <strong>metadata</strong>.</p>
<p>The metadata is then packaged into a cryptographically signed artifact attestation, which can be stored in a trusted repository or distributed to consumers of the software. This process ensures that the provenance of the software build and its associated metadata are verifiable and tamper-proof. You can imagine the process as similar to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The concept of attestation and metadata has been present in the industry for decades, but it is only recently that we have started seeing more tools and services emerging to support this. GitHub, for instance, has recently launched a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/">public beta</a> for artifact attestations.</p>
<h2 id="How-Attestation-Comes-to-the-Rescue">How Attestation Comes to the Rescue</h2>
<p>Attestation-centric DevSecOps transforms the fragmented tooling landscape into a unified, verifiable ecosystem. Instead of forcing tools to integrate directly with each other, attestations create a common language that all tools can speak.</p>
<h3 id="Breaking-Down-Silos-with-Shared-Evidence">Breaking Down Silos with Shared Evidence</h3>
<p>Imagine Sarah, a security engineer at a large financial institution. Her team uses Snyk for vulnerability scanning, while the mobile team prefers Checkmarx, and the infrastructure team relies on Prisma Cloud. Previously, correlating security findings across these teams required manual effort and often led to gaps in coverage.</p>
<p>With attestation-centric DevSecOps, each tool generates cryptographically signed attestations about its findings. When Sarah needs to assess the security posture of a mobile application that uses shared infrastructure components, she can trace the complete security journey through attestations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code Attestation</strong>: Confirms the source code integrity and author identity</li>
<li><strong>Build Attestation</strong>: Verifies the build environment and process</li>
<li><strong>Scan Attestation</strong>: Documents security findings from multiple tools</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Attestation</strong>: Records the deployment environment and configuration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Supply-Chain-Transparency-Made-Simple">Supply Chain Transparency Made Simple</h3>
<p>The recent surge in supply chain attacks, from SolarWinds to Log4j, has made enterprises acutely aware of their blind spots. Traditional approaches often rely on Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), but these are static snapshots that don’t capture the dynamic nature of modern software development.</p>
<p>Attestation-centric approaches provide a living audit trail. When a new vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library, security teams can quickly identify all affected applications by querying attestations rather than manually checking each project’s dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="Real-World-Implementation-The-Three-Pillars">Real-World Implementation: The Three Pillars</h2>
<h3 id="Pillar-1-Standardized-Metadata-Collection">Pillar 1: Standardized Metadata Collection</h3>
<p>Every tool in your DevSecOps pipeline should generate attestations in a standardized format. This doesn’t mean replacing your existing tools—it means augmenting them with attestation capabilities.</p>
<pre class="language-yaml" data-language="yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token comment"># Example attestation metadata</span>
<span class="token key atrule">subject</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>

      <span class="token key atrule">digest</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"sha1:def456..."</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="Pillar-2-Cryptographic-Verification">Pillar 2: Cryptographic Verification</h3>
<p>All attestations must be cryptographically signed to ensure integrity and non-repudiation. This creates an immutable chain of custody that can withstand sophisticated attacks.</p>
<h3 id="Pillar-3-Queryable-Attestation-Store">Pillar 3: Queryable Attestation Store</h3>
<p>Attestation data should be stored in a centralized, queryable system that allows security teams to ask complex questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Show me all applications built from code committed by external contributors in the last 30 days”</li>
<li>“Which deployments contain the vulnerable version of library X?”</li>
<li>“What security scans were performed on this artifact before production deployment?”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Path-Forward-Starting-Small-Thinking-Big">The Path Forward: Starting Small, Thinking Big</h2>
<p>Implementing attestation-centric DevSecOps doesn’t require a complete overhaul of your existing infrastructure. Start with these practical steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pilot with Build Attestations</strong>: Begin by generating build provenance attestations for your most critical applications</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Gradually</strong>: Add attestation capabilities to your existing security tools one at a time</li>
<li><strong>Establish Policies</strong>: Define what attestations are required for different types of deployments</li>
<li><strong>Train Your Teams</strong>: Ensure developers and security engineers understand how to interpret and use attestation data</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Trust-Through-Transparency">Conclusion: Trust Through Transparency</h2>
<p>In an era where software supply chains are under constant threat and enterprise development teams operate in increasingly complex environments, attestation-centric DevSecOps offers a path to both security and operational efficiency. By creating verifiable, cryptographic evidence of every step in the software development lifecycle, organizations can move from a position of hoping their security measures are effective to knowing they are.</p>
<p>The future of enterprise software security isn’t about having more tools—it’s about having better visibility into how those tools work together to protect your organization. Attestation-centric DevSecOps provides that visibility, one cryptographic signature at a time.</p>
